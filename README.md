# TiSQLEditor

SQL Editor is built on [CodeMirror6](https://codemirror.net/), a modern code editor that is written in TypeScript and supports a wide range of extensions. Based on that, we provide a set of extensions to make it easy to use and easy to extend, all these features are validated in the [TiDB Cloud](https://tidbcloud.com), with countless customers all around the world. We also contribute to the CodeMirror6 project, and we are happy to share our extensions with the community.
